    To describe a position on the Earth the most commonly using system is
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system">a geographic coordinate system</a>.
    The geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables
    every location on the Earth to be specified by a set of numbers or letters.
    A common choice of coordinates is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a>
    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>.
    With this information we can calculate a distance between two points along a surface.
</p>

<p>
    For simplicity we will suppose that Earth is a perfect sphere with radius 6371 kilometers (earth mean radius).
    You are given two point coordinates and you should find
    the shortest distance between these points on the surface of the Earth,
    measured along the surface of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
    Coordinates are given as a strings with latitude and longitude separated by whitespace.
    Latitude and longitude are represented in the follow format:
</p>

<pre>
    d°m′s″X
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    where "d" is degrees, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds as integers.
    And "X" is "N" (north) or "S" (south) for a latitude and
    "W" (west) or "E" (east) for a longitude.
</p>

<p>
    The result should be given as a number by kilometers with precision &plusmn;0.001.
        </p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Coordinates as strings (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The distance as a number (int or float).

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This method can be used to estimate a distance for air or sea navigation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    Coordinates are correct.
